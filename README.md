# Portfolio
Portfolio for my coding work.

## Purpose

This project aimed to set up an online portfolio to display all of my work as the class progresses.

## Credits

The design idea for how to hover came from one of our in-class miniprojects. I simply changed it to suit my needs. 

The reset.css file was copied from the class reset file in Module 2 Activity 12. 

Thanks to my tutor Sara Neeves Pereira for all of her help.
